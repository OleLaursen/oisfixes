This project contains the Django code for managing fixes for OIS
geodata as used in OpenStreetMap.

OIS is a public Danish data repository which among other things is
used to import almost all address nodes in Denmark in OpenStreetMap.
The data is updated by the local municipalities in Denmark
(kommunerne) and is generally of a really high quality. But of course
some mistakes have been found so a repository is needed to collect
them and ensure the OpenStreetMap OIS/OSAK importer can amend them.

The source code for this project is released under the GPL version 3
as published by the Free Software Foundation, or at your option, any
later version.
